            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my personal website. My name is  Kevin Aparicio, a Computer Science major. I would also like to let you know that I am a deaf person, but that hasnâ€™t stopped me from moving forward. I am currently enrolled at LaGuardia Community College pursuing my associates degree in Computer Science with intended to graduate this summer of 2024. After that I will be transferring to John Jay to obtain my Bachelors degree. My goal in life is to be part of a team where I can learn from other talented people and share my expertise with them. Pushing and thriving together to deliver the mission of the company. I have experienced what hard work
                 can be from working in the hospitality industry for over 8 years. Working long hours with a team and taking on leadership roles has shaped me into the person I am today. Turning me into a more resilient, tougher, relentless and clever person. Hopefully someday I can show you my abilities. Thank you. </p>
